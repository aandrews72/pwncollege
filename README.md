# pwncollege

This is a collection of my casual notes primarily based on lectures from pwn.college. I won't be adding solutions/solve scripts to this repo to maintain the integrity of the challenges. **These notes are informal.** They're meant to serve as a personal reference, confirm my understanding of the material, and do be a place where I can leave questions that I can come back to.

Feel free to explore, but **keep in mind that these are personal notes and may not always be comprehensive or neatly organized!**
