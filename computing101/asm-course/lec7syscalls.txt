What are system calls:
They take an instruction that makes a call into the OS
sysclal triggers the system call specified by the value in rax
arguments in rdi rsi rdx r10 r8 and r9, ret value in rax 
It makes the OS handle program interaction with the rest of the environment

Reading 100 bytes from stdin to the stack:
n = read(0, buf, 100)
mov rdi, 0
mov rsi, rsp
mov rdx, 100
mov rax, 0
