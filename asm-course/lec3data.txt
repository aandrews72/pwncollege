Data 

The CPU only underestands binary, 1 or 0

Binary is a base 2 number system, wher binary digits are called bits.

Why do computers speak binary? Consider the logic gate.
a. A, B, Q represented in slides are either "on" or "off" (logic gates depicted)
b. these concepts can be mapped to 1 and 0
c. on/off are easy to check for 


Humans and Binary
Round numbers doing line up well with binary and decimal 
But if we use a base that is a power of two, base 4 8 16 etc it lines up cleaner. So we use base 16 (hex) a bit more since it aligns better.


Expressing text
Bits in a computer typically do something useful.
Exmaples: encoding asm instructions, programs, imgaes, text.
So ASCII is helpful for encoding with 7 bits. 
ASCII has evolved into UTF-8, used 98% of the web


Grouping bits into bytes 
8 bits = 1 bytes
This is due to text encoding, the amount of bits to a byte is subjective


How do we express negative numbers?
Two's complement - negative numbers have the same representation as positive numbers 
0 - 1 = 0b11111111 = 255 = -1 
With signed/unsigned 
Signing cuts the range of positive numbers in half because half of the bit representations are reserved for negative numbers


Anataomy of a word: 0xc001c475
Higher bits in order: c0 01
Lower bits in order of lowest: 75 c4
Most significant bits to least significant: c0 01 c4 75




Q's
What does it mean when a CPU is 64 bit or 32 bit?
It describes the width of the processor's data bus, registers, and general architecture
