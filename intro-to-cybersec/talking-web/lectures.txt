Introduction:
WWW is a web of information, hypertext links take us to other pages


All these distributed pages are speaking a universal language, HTTP. This allows sites to reach out to another. This sends an HTTP GET request to a web server hosting this resource we are requesting. They all just speak a standardized langauge. 

Dynamic HTTP request - GET request for time of UTC where web server does computations. 







------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet:

Infrastructure for www. WWW needs a system to communicate with other machines/resources

Basic idea: to communicate remotely we use a medium to transmit the message. If my system isn't physically connected how do we do this? We can use the internet! It is a distributed system of machines. Messages go from system to system to system etc. to end destination. 

Network of networks. 

Abstraction - to service http requests we use the internet as a system to pass messages along to abstract away the system passing these requests away.

The abstraction takes away lots of the particulars of the TCP/IP model so we have:
Data - which has a UDP header and UDP data, which is apart of the IP data where we add an IP header, which is all apart of a frames data which is encapsulated by a frame header and footer.

Link layer - frame. Physical links of computers. Passing info to neighboring systems. 

Internet layer - IP header/data. Concerned with finding right node/destination. IP, ICMP, ARP. Not every node is directly connected to another but they're all indirectly connected. 

Transport layer on top of internte layer. UDP/TCP header and data. Wants to find the right PROGRAM. Concerned with ports, so we're on the right machine but we need to get to the right program. Provides a circuit connection / reliability. 

Application layer - data. HTTP. How will we talk to the program? What protocol will we use. Standardized language. Can also use FTP, SMTP, SSH, 






-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RFC 1945:

First request for comment to define http. The need to standardize requests/replies. RFC 1945 laid out exactly what HTTP is. 

Simple HTTP request - send out data over internet. 
GET / HTTP/1.0 - This is the request line: 
Request-line = Method <space> Request-URI <space> HTTP-Version <CRLF>
The GET is our method, the action we take. We have GET HEAD and POST (in RFC 1945). 
Request-URI is the / here. 
HTTP-Version is HTTP/1.0.

Response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK 
Status-Line = HTTP-Version <space> Status-code <space> Reason-phrase <CRLF>
HTTP/1.0 is the http version 
200 is the status code 
Reason phrase is OK.

Status Code definition. 
1xx Informational 
2xx Success 
3xx Redirection 
4xx Client error
5xx Server error

Method definitions: GET HEAD POST 
GET - retrieve information is identified by the request-uri. If the request-URI refrs to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process,  unless that text happens to be the output of the process.
Full HTTP Request: GET 
GET /greet HTTP/1.0
Host: hello.example.com

Response: GET 
HTTP/1.0 200 OK 
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 39 
<html><body>Hello, World!</body></html>

HEAD: Identical to get but server must not return any entity-body in the response. The metainfo contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request should be identical to the info sent in response to a GET request. We'd get everything but the hello world/html compared to prev get request. 


POST - request that dest server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the request-uri in the request-line. 
POST allows us to push data to server as opposed to previous two where we receive info from the server.





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
URLs and Encoding 

<scheme>://<host>:<port>/<path>?<query>#<fragment>

scheme: protocol used to access resource 
host: host that holds resource
port: port for program servicing resource
path: identifies the specific resource
query: information that the resource can use 
fragment: client information about the resource 


http://example.com:80/cat.gif?width=256&height=256#t=2s

scheme = http
host = example.com (server holding resource)
port = 80. transport layer, a server may have serveral services being run, this specifies the service.
path = cat.gif. identifies the specific resource we want access to
query = width=256&height=256. This is what we need to maybe get the resource or interact with that resource 
fragment = client specific information


Recall: request-line = method <space> Request-URI <space> HTTP-Version CRLF
Regarding the request-uri - critical component of URL 

There are some unsafe and or illegal characters that if we enter with our GET request will create problems. A way to get around this is to encode those unsafe characters into hex. So we have the space character mapped to %20 - (hex)

So instead of 
GET /Hello World HTTP/1.0
Host: hello.example.com

It'd be
GET /Hello%20World HTTP/1.0
Host: hello.example.com

There are other encoding types, that was for URL but there are other for various content-types.

Content-Type: application/x-ww-form-urlencoded: name=Connor
We can also use JSON content-type: application/json {"name": "Connor"} 




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

State

There are various program states other then just the static state we've been using like dynamic.

The issue with state here is the http is a stateless protocol, this creates an issue if we want to maintain state. 

The solution to this problem is http cookies. 
We can use HTTP headers for maintaining state. 
1. The server sets a cookie in response with the header: Set-Cookie
2. The client includes the cookie in future requests with header: Cookie

The server can now use the cookie provided in those future requests

Making HTTP requests

curl -X POST 127.0.0.1 = send post request
curl 127.0.0.1 = get resources at that ip 
curl -X POST -H 'User-Agent: Connor' 127.0.0.1 = makes us appear as Connor instead of curl

nc example.com 80 = connect to example.com on port 80
Then it will hang, it will wait for us to type in some input. So after entering the above we can do 
Get / HTTP/1.0
Host: example.com 

or 

GET /test-it HTTP/1.0 
Host: example.com 


In python we can use the requests library 

import requests
response = requests.get('http://emaple.com')
response 
response.text
response.headers 
for k, v in response.headers.items():
    print(f"{k}: {v}")
